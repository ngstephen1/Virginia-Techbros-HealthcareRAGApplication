Given the considerable global burden of T2DM, innovative therapeutic approaches to improve patient outcomes remain a public health priority. This review\ufb01rst provides an in-depth analysis of the current state of therapy, from novel pharmacotherapy to lifestyle interventions and new treatment methods. At the same time, the rapidly increasing role of AI in diabetes care is woven into the story, mainly targeting how insulin therapy can be modi\ufb01ed and personalized through algorithms and predictive modelling. It leaves a deep review of their pre-existing synergies, which helps understand how collaborative opportunities will unlock the future of T2DM care. This critical role is shown by integrating recent therapeutic advances and AI with overall showcasing better screening, diagnosis, and therapeutics decision-making to outcome prediction in T2DM. The review emphasizes how AI applications in insulin therapy have transformative potential in diabetes care. These person-centred approaches to T2DM management, which are more effective and personalized than some traditional strategies, only work because of the often-hidden synergies between AI algorithms in areas such as diagnostic criteria, predictive methods, and familiar classi\ufb01cation tools for subgroups with relevant aspects/predictors on prognosis or treatment responsiveness. \u00a9 2025 The Author(s).

Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis 15 (2025) 101305 long-term complications associated with diabetes is still uncertain [1]. Obesity and T2DM are major public health concerns, often linked with adiposopathy, which describes the pathophysiological changes in adipose tissue. This dysfunctional state of adipose tissue is a signi\ufb01cant factor in the aetiology of these conditions, promot- ing chronic in\ufb02ammation, dysregulated glucose homeostasis, and insulin resistance. Currently, the most successful strategies for achieving signi\ufb01cant weight loss and consequent diabetes remis- sion are metabolic surgery and innovative categories of antidiabetic drugs [2]. A comprehensive lifestyle clinic study demonstrated the impact of non-pharmacological interventions on metabolic health and remission of these conditions, highlighting the importance of personalized physical exercise and nutritional counselling [3]. The integration of recent therapeutic advances and arti\ufb01cial intelli- gence (AI) is now used for diagnosis, therapeutic decision-making, and outcome prediction in T2DM. AI applications in T2DM care primarily focus on screening and diagnosis in different stages, with machine learning (ML) methods being the most commonly applied techniques. These methods, including support vector machine and naive Bayesian, have shown promise in improving diabetes-related outcomes classi\ufb01cation [4]. The development of AI-driven clinical decision support systems (CDSS) integrated with electronic health records (EHR) represents a signi\ufb01cant step forward. These plat- forms assist healthcare providers and individuals in examining pertinent patient data, establishing therapeutic objectives, and considering different treatment options based on forecasts, thus enhancing the support for pharmacological decision-making in T2DM [5]. The importance of precise and personalized manage- ment strategies in T2DM care can not be overstated, given the impact of individual characteristics and lifestyle on treatment plans and patient outcomes.

AI offers great promise in combining pat- terns from various data sources with healthcare professionals' expertise to achieve optimal care. Studies have shown that AI- generated individualized feedback can lead to improved health behaviours and better management of T2DM [6]( Figs. 1A and B). Furthermore, AI interpretation and graph neural networks (GNN) are being used to explore risk factors for complications associated with T2DM, such as cognitive impairment, and to screen potential therapeutic drugs. This approach not only aids in under- standing the underlying mechanisms of T2DM complications but also assists in discovering effective treatments [7]. This review aims to provide insights into more effective, personalized, and patient- centric management approaches for T2DM by examining how AI can complement and enhance traditional therapeutic strategies. Hence, the objective of this review is dual:\ufb01rstly, to present a comprehensive overview of the existing treatment alternatives for T2DM, and secondly, to examine the burgeoning intersection of these therapies with AI. By merging these two aspects, we aim to shed light on the prospective collaborative dynamics that may arise between them. This review is structured to provide a comprehen- sive understanding of the evolving landscape of T2DM manage- ment. The initial sections explore traditional approaches, including pharmacotherapy and lifestyle interventions, emphasising their role in managing the disease's complexity. Subsequently, the re- view discusses how AI has emerged as a transformative force in diabetes care, offering innovations in predictive analytics, decision- making support, and personalized treatment strategies. The\ufb01nal sections delve into the synergies between these advancements, highlighting the integration of AI with modern therapeutics to create patient-centred and outcome-driven management frame- works. By bridging conventional methods with cutting-edge tech- nology, this review aims to provide insights into the future trajectory of T2DM care. Recent advances like regulation-aware graph learning have demonstrated the potential of leveraging heterogeneous biological networks and connectivity patterns for effective drug repositioning, achieving superior performance in predicting drug-disease associations [ 8]. Graph representation learning models, such as FuHLDR, have introduced innovative ap- proaches by integrating higher and lower-order biological infor- mation, demonstrating enhanced effectiveness in drug repositioning compared to state-of-the-art models [9]. Network- based computational approaches like large-scale graph drug- target interactions (LGDTI), which integrate local and global rep- resentations of drugs and proteins, have shown remarkable accu- racy in predicting drug-target interactions by leveraging heterogeneous information networks [ 10]. The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test requires fasting for at least 8 h and needs con\ufb01rmation with a second test on a different day if the result is abnormal (/C21126 mg/dL or/C217.0 mmol/L) [11]. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with a 75 g glucose load is conducted following World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Diagnosis is con \ufb01rmed with a second test on a different day, where a 2-h plasma glucose (PG) level of/C21200 mg/dL (/C2111.1 mmol/L) during the OGTT indicates diabetes [12].

The diagnosis is based on a single haemoglobin A1c (HbA1C) test using the National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program (NGSP)-certi\ufb01ed and Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) standardized laboratory method, with an HbA1C level of /C216.5% (/C2148 mmol/mol) [13]. The current diagnostic standards for T2DM are summarised inTable 1[11e13]. 2. Therapeutic modalities for T2DM 2.1. Pharmacotherapy The treatment of T2DM involves a variety of medications that target different aspects of the disease's underlying mechanisms. 2.1.1. Oral antidiabetic agents Oral antidiabetic agents, commonly called oral hypoglycemic agents or oral hypoglycemics, function through various mecha- nisms to regulate blood sugar levels, aiming to improve insulin sensitivity, enhance insulin secretion, or reduce glucose absorption from the digestive tract. The development and utilization of oral antidiabetic agents have evolved signi \ufb01cantly over the years, re\ufb02ecting advancements in our understanding of diabetes patho- physiology and the quest for more effective and patient-friendly treatment options. As an integral component of diabetes manage- ment, oral antidiabetic agents are often prescribed based on indi- vidual needs, considering factors such as the type and severity of diabetes, overall health, and any coexisting medical conditions. The diverse classes of oral antidiabetic agents include biguanides, sul- fonylureas, meglitinides, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitors [14,15]. 2.1.2. Biguanides Without contraindications, metformin is regarded as the\ufb01rst- line medication for treating T2DM. Metformin appears to reduce blood and liver levels of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), reduction of LPS and mechanism of action of metformin [16e18]. Metformin acti- vates adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in liver cells, leading to the activation of AMPK in hepa- tocytes [19]. It also suppresses adenyl cyclase, which inhibits glucagon-induced cyclic AMP (cAMP) generation, demonstrating its mechanism of action through the suppression of adenyl cyclase [20 ]. Activation of hepatic AMPK leads to the activation of liver- kinase B1 (LKB1), which describes the mechanism of action by which AMPK activates LKB1 [21,22]. At high doses, metformin in- hibits complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, which lowers adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and increases A. Sen, P.S. Mohanraj, V. Laxmi et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis 15 (2025) 101305 2 the AMP/ATP ratio. This mechanism of action involves inhibition of complex I in the mitochondria [23]. Inhibition of mitochondrial glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (mG3PDH) disrupts gluconeo- genesis from lactate [ 24]. Metformin's component, LKB1, may activate AMPK and contribute to the inhibition of cell growth by activating the tumor suppressor protein LKB1 [25]. Observational research indicates that metformin may reduce the risk of devel- oping cancer by mechanisms that lower cancer risk [26]. Its diverse mechanisms of action and associated effects are listed inTable 2 [16e26]. 2.1.3. Blockers of alpha-glucosidase Acarbose, miglitol, and voglibose are the currently approved drugs in this class. Inhibition of alpha-glucosidase in the small in- testine's brush border membrane"}

Its diverse mechanisms of action and associated effects are listed inTable 2 [16e26]. 2.1.3. Blockers of alpha-glucosidase Acarbose, miglitol, and voglibose are the currently approved drugs in this class. Inhibition of alpha-glucosidase in the small in- testine's brush border membrane results in decreased absorption of carbohydrates as the conversion of complex non-absorbable oli- gosaccharides into simple absorbable monosaccharides is blocked by alpha-glucosidase inhibitors [27]. Because alpha-glucosidase inhibitors might cause asymptomatic elevations in liver enzymes and are not advised for individuals with creatinine clearance below 25 mL/min, it is vital to manage liver enzyme levels [28].

DPP-4 inhibitors Different dipeptidyl peptidase inhibitors (iDPPs) are sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin. Incretins are a group of gastrointestinal hormones that play a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism. The two main incretin hormones are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insu- linotropic polypeptide (GIP). These hormones are released from the gut in response to food intake and act on pancreatic beta cells to stimulate insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner. Addi- tionally, incretins suppress glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, delay gastric emptying, and promote satiety [29]. The mechanism of action of DPP-4 inhibitors involves inhibiting the enzyme DPP-4, which results in increased levels of GLP-1 and GIP. This leads to enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion, sup- pression of glucagon secretion, slowed gastric emptying, and improved glycemic control. Due to the minimal risk of hypoglyce- mia and other adverse effects, these drugs are considered as being relatively safe. When using insulin and sulfonylureas together, each of them has an increased risk of hypoglycemia [30]. 2.1.5.

When using insulin and sulfonylureas together, each of them has an increased risk of hypoglycemia [30]. 2.1.5. The insulin secretagogues-sulfonylureas and meglitinides Although they belong to separate groups of oral hypoglycemic medications, sulfonylureas and insulin secretagogues (meglitinides or glinides) promote insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells. Since they were initially made available for use in clinical settings in the 1950s, sulfonylureas have been the de facto\ufb01rst- or second- line therapy for people with T2DM [31,32]. Although sulfonylureas and glinides bind to the receptor at different sites, they both cause channel closure and cell depolarization, which raises cytoplasmic calcium levels and, as a result, causes the release of insulin. Second- generation sulfonylureas include glimepiride, glipizide, gliclazide, and glyburide [16]. Meglitinides are advantageous for those for whom the objective of avoiding hypoglycaemic episodes is crucial since they typically have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia [ 33]. Repaglinide and nateglinide are two distinct glinides. The phenyl- alanine derivative nateglinide differs structurally from sulfonyl- ureas and meglitinide. Sulfonylureas considerably in\ufb02uence FPG concentrations due to their pharmacokinetics, while meglitinides mainly affect postprandial glucose levels [34]. Sulfonylureas are likely to reduce HbA1C by 1.0%e1.5%, although meglitinides are often less ef\ufb01cient in lowering blood sugar (0.5%e1.0%) [16,22]. Hypoglycemia is the most frequent side effect, particularly with long-acting sulfonylureas (such as glyburide/glimepiride) [35e37]. 2.1.6. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor In individuals with T2DM, SGLT2 inhibitors renal glucose reab- sorption and increases glucose excretion. It works independently of insulin, carries no risk of hypoglycemia, and does not induce fatigue or excessive stimulation of beta cells [38]. Because its method of action depends on proper glomerular-tubular function, individuals with renal insuf\ufb01ciency have decreased SGLT2 ef\ufb01ciency [39]. The three medications that best typify the SGLT2 drug family are empagli\ufb02ozin, dapagli \ufb02ozin and canagli \ufb02ozin [40]. They have proven effective in improving glycemic control and lowering body weight in patients with T2DM [41]. If these medications may also reduce the dosage of insulin, weight loss will be higher. Patients experience more weight loss more quickly [42]. The impact of these medications on the lipid pro\ufb01le is unclear. All of the SGLT2 do not provide the same outcomes. Some studies found them to be lipid- friendly and lipid-neutral in others [43,44]. Finally, since SGLT2 is linked to glomerular hyper-\ufb01ltration, blocking it may have neph- roprotective effects [45]. SGLT2 inhibitors have demonstrated sig- ni\ufb01cant cardiovascular protective effects by reducing major adverse cardiovascular events, improving heart function, lowering heart failure risk, and promoting renal health. These bene\ufb01ts extend to individuals both with and without diabetes, suggesting their po- tential to prevent heart-related complications and improve overall cardiac outcomes [46]. 2.1.7. TZDs Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are the two TZDs that are mar- keted in the United States. Because the overall hazards of rosigli- tazone outweigh the bene\ufb01ts, the European Medicines Agency has prohibited its use in Europe since 2010 [47]. The mechanism of action of TZDs involves activating peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPARg), a nuclear"}

Because the overall hazards of rosigli- tazone outweigh the bene\ufb01ts, the European Medicines Agency has prohibited its use in Europe since 2010 [47]. The mechanism of action of TZDs involves activating peroxisome proliferator- activated receptor gamma (PPARg), a nuclear receptor primarily found in adipose tissue but also present in other tissues such as the liver, muscle, and pancreas. Activation of PPARg leads to increased insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, such as muscle and adipose tissue. These results in improved glucose uptake and utilization by cells, decreased hepatic glucose production, and reduced circu- lating levels of free fatty acids [48]. TZDs also affect adipocyte dif- ferentiation and adipokine secretion, which can contribute to their metabolic effects [49]. The activation of PPARg in the central nervous system, pro- moting heightened appetite, contributes to the weight gain asso- ciated with TZD [50]. Because PPARg is more common in the collecting tubules of the nephron, TZD treatment-induced PPARg activation results in salt absorption in those cells, causing retention of \ufb02uid that may cause or aggravate heart failure [51]. 2.2. Injectable antidiabetic agents Injectable antidiabetic agents constitute a crucial category of medications employed in treating and managing diabetes mellitus. Injectable antidiabetic agents are primarily utilized in cases where oral medications may be insuf\ufb01cient in achieving glycemic control, particularly in individuals with more advanced stages of diabetes or Table 2 Possible mechanisms of action for metformin.

Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is vital for glucose utilization, and injectable insulin is often prescribed when the body's natural in- sulin production is inadequate [53]. GLP-1 RAs mimic the action of a naturally occurring hormone, GLP-1, which stimulates insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon release. By enhancing insulin ac- tivity and suppressing the release of glucose from the liver, GLP-1 RAs contribute to improved glycemic control [54]. Injectable anti- diabetic agents are an essential component of diabetes manage- ment, offering \ufb02exibility and precision in addressing the diverse needs of individuals with diabetes when a more rapid and direct impact on blood glucose levels is required. The selection of inject- able antidiabetic agents is based on factors such as the type of diabetes and individual patient characteristics [30]. 2.2.1. Insulin Pre-meal coverage with traditional insulin has a quicker onset and a shorter half-life than long-acting analogues, which allow a once-daily dose. It also shows less daily variation [55]. In addition to long-acting insulins like glargine and detemir, ultra-long-acting insulins like degludec and glargine U-300 and rapid-acting insulins like aspart, lispro or glulisine may be used together. Human insulin and insulin glargine are equivalent, except for the two extra argi- nine molecules added to the B-chain and the substitution of glycine for asparagine at position A21 [56]. With a half-life of over 25 h and an action of over 42 h, the insulin degludec pro\ufb01le is \ufb02atter than other long-acting insulins (glargine and detemir), reducing acute and overnight hypoglycemias [57]. Compared to glargine, insulin degludec demonstrates non-inferiority in lowering HbA1C and a reduced risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia [58]. 2.2.2. RA-GLP1 After eating, the body secretes the hormone GLP-1, which stimulates insulin release to regulate blood sugar levels. GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), produced by enteroendocrine L-cells in different parts of the digestive tract, play key roles in this process. In T2DM, GLP-1 treatments enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion, reducing the risk of hypo- glycemia. These treatments also lower glucagon levels, slow gastric emptying to moderate postprandial blood sugar spikes, and in- crease satiety, aiding in weight management and overall blood glucose control [54]. RA-GLP1 are categorized as short-acting or long-acting, depending on how long they persist. Short-acting RA- GLP1 medications include lixisenatide and twice-daily exenatide. Lixisenatide has a considerably longer half-life (2.7e4.3 h) than native GLP1. Additionally, lixisenatide has been used with basal insulin treatment [59,60]. Exenatide long-acting release (LAR) is more effective than the maximum dosage of twice-daily exenatide, sitagliptin, pioglitazone, and insulin glargine in T2DM patients using oral hypoglycemic medications [61e64]. 3.

Recent efforts in this \ufb01eld focus on the potential for disease remission, the inno- vation and development of new medications, and comprehensive management strategies. These advancements aim to enhance the quality of life for individuals with T2DM by providing more effective glycemic control, reducing complications, and inte- grating patient-centric care models. The following sections will delve into the latest developments, including promising drugs currently in clinical trials, and explore how these innovations reshape the future of T2DM treatment [ 66]. Clinical trials of orforglipron are advancing into phase 2, demonstrating its po- tential as an innovative oral non-peptide GLP-1 RA [67]. Maz- dutide is advancing in phase 2 trials, showcasing its promising dual-action mechanism [ 68]. By functioning as a weak GLP-1 agonist alongside a glucagon receptor agonist, it offers a unique approach to treatment [69]. This promising drug, dorzagliatin, is currently undergoing phase 3 clinical trials and acts as a dual- acting glucokinase activator, targeting both hepatic and pancre- atic functions [70]. Imeglimin is currently undergoing a Phase 2 clinical trial and works through a tetrahydrotriazine-based structure, which helps restore and prevent mitochondrial dysfunction in pancreatic b cells [71]. Summarise all ongoing clinical trials of novel therapies for T2DM are listed inTable 3 [67e71]. 4. Lifestyle modi\ufb01cations Modifying dietary habits commonly entails adhering to a controlled diet that emphasizes equilibrium between energy intake and expenditure. This generally translates to a diet low in processed sugars and saturated fats while abundant in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables [ 72]. Consistent physical activity is key to enhancing insulin sensitivity, managing blood sugar levels, and mitigating cardiovascular risk factors. A well-rounded exercise routine typically includes aerobic activities like walking, swimming, cycling, and resistance training. The objective is to attain a harmonious exercise regimen that facili- tates glucose regulation, comprehensive physical \ufb01tness, and effective weight management [73]. Sleep is a frequently under- estimated facet of lifestyle management for T2DM. Research in- dicates that obtaining 6 /C09 h of sleep can diminish cardio- metabolic risk factors in individuals with T2DM. On the con- trary, insuf\ufb01cient sleep can worsen various complications linked to T2DM, including hypertension, hyperglycemia, insulin resis- tance, and dyslipidemia. Hence, prioritising suf\ufb01cient and high- quality sleep is equally signi\ufb01cant alongside diet and exercise in the comprehensive management of T2DM [20]. Managing T2DM through lifestyle modi\ufb01cations underscores the signi \ufb01cance of adopting a well-rounded strategy encompassing dietary adjust- ments, physical activity, and suf\ufb01cient sleep.

Diet Recent research has spotlighted personalized dietary strategies tailored to individual needs, mainly focusing on approaches like low-carbohydrate diets, Mediterranean diets, and time-restricted feeding. These nuanced dietary interventions have exhibited promising outcomes in enhancing glycemic control and positively impacting metabolic parameters among individuals with T2DM. When individuals adhere to these customised dietary guidelines, the bene \ufb01ts extend beyond glycemic control. Studies have demonstrated a decrease in the prevalence of urinary incontinence among women, alongside improvements in conditions such as sleep apnea, depression, and the overall health-related quality of life. The relationship between obesity and insulin secretion adds complexity to the understanding of T2DM. Exploring these con- nections sheds light on the intricate interplay between metabolic factors, dietary choices, and overall health in T2DM. By losing weight, one will become more sensitive to insulin, improving one's ability to manage one's blood sugar levels. Consuming enough di- etary \ufb01bre, particularly \ufb01bre that contains natural resources, has been demonstrated to enhance glycemic control and cardiovascular risk factor management, which lowers the risk of cardiovascular mortality in people with diabetes [74,75]. Epidemiological research has linked fats to an increased risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease [76]. Studies on the Mediterranean diet have shown that monounsaturated fatty acids, notably when swapped out for saturated fatty acids, may reduce cardiovascular risk factors and improve glycemic management [77]. Individualized reduced so- dium intake should be used when people also have hypertension, which is prevalent [78]. 4.2. Exercise Regular physical activity and exercise have maintained their status as fundamental pillars in managing T2DM. They have demonstrated notable bene\ufb01ts, including enhanced insulin sensi- tivity, improved glucose control, favourable alterations in lipid pro- \ufb01les and overall cardiovascular health. The positive impact on mental health includes a reduction in depression, emphasising the holistic bene\ufb01ts of incorporating exercise into the routine of individuals with T2DM [72,79,80]. Exercise has proven to be bene\ufb01cial in preventing the onset of peripheral neuropathy. However, it is advisable to ex- ercise caution, especially in individuals with existing foot ulcers and sores. It is recommended to avoid activities that exert repetitive stress on the lower extremities in such cases. This cautious approach ensures that the positive effects of exercise in preventing peripheral neuropathy are realised without compromising the safety and well- being of individuals with pre-existing foot conditions [81,82]. How- ever, it is crucial to ensure adequate hydration. It is uncommon for T2DM to involve a severe insulin de\ufb01cit akin to type 1 diabetes (T1D).

How- ever, it is crucial to ensure adequate hydration. It is uncommon for T2DM to involve a severe insulin de\ufb01cit akin to type 1 diabetes (T1D). Maintaining appropriate hydration conditions becomes particularly important in the context of physical activity, contributing to overall health and helping manage the potential effects of hyperglycemia in individuals with T2DM [83]. 5. AI in diabetes care Integrating AI in diabetes care represents a transformative shift in managing this chronic and complex condition. Recent studies have illuminated the multifaceted applications of AI in diabetes management, encompassing patient education, clinical decision support, and predictive analytics, each contributing to a more nuanced and practical approach to diabetes care. AI's role in patient education and self-management is particularly noteworthy. AI- driven applications and platforms can provide personalized educa- tion, dietary recommendations, and lifestyle advice tailored to in- dividual patient pro\ufb01les. This personalisation is crucial, as diabetes management depends on patient behaviour and lifestyle choices. AI systems can analyse patient data to offer customised advice and even predict potential challenges a patient might face, enabling preemptive action [84]. In clinical decision support, AI has shown immense potential in enhancing the accuracy and ef\ufb01ciency of diabetes management. AI algorithms can analyse vast amounts of patient data, including blood glucose levels, dietary habits, and ex- ercise routines, to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions. This can include medication adjustments, insulin dosage recommendations, and identifying patients at risk of complications such as hypoglycemia. By providing real-time, data-driven insights, AI aids clinicians in delivering more precise and effective care. Pre- dictive analytics is another area where AI is making signi\ufb01cant strides in diabetes care [85]. AI models can predict the onset of diabetes-related complications, such as diabetic retinopathy or kidney disease, allowing for early intervention. This predictive capability is vital for preventing or delaying complications, often the most challenging and costly aspects of diabetes management. Moreover, AI is revolutionizing the monitoring and management of blood glucose levels. Integrated with AI algorithms, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems can analyse glucose data in real- time, providing patients with actionable insights to manage their condition effectively [86]. These systems can alert patients to po- tential hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia events, enabling timely intervention. The integration of AI in diabetes care also extends to the development of advanced insulin delivery systems. AI-powered closed-loop systems, also known as arti\ufb01cial pancreas systems, can automatically adjust insulin delivery based on CGM data, signi\ufb01- cantly reducing the burden of daily diabetes management for pa- tients [87]( Fig. 2). However, integrating AI in diabetes care is not challenging. Issues such as data privacy, the need for extensive and diverse datasets to train AI models and ensuring equitable access to AI-driven tools are critical concerns that need addressing. Addi- tionally, there is a need for collaboration between technologists, clinicians, patients, and policymakers to ensure that AI tools are effectively integrated into healthcare systems and are accessible to all patients, regardless of"}

Addi- tionally, there is a need for collaboration between technologists, clinicians, patients, and policymakers to ensure that AI tools are effectively integrated into healthcare systems and are accessible to all patients, regardless of socioeconomic status. AI's role in diabetes management spans education, clinical decision support, and pre- dictive analytics. Advanced algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), aid in complication prediction, including reti- nopathy and nephropathy. AI-powered platforms like Information Data Exchange-Diabetic Retinopathy (IDx-DR) exemplify technology integration into clinical practice, providing automated diabetic retinopathy screening. Additionally, AI-driven decision-support systems, such as those used in hospital settings, enhance insulin and drug dosing by analyzing real-time patient data to suggest opti- mized treatment plans. These tools not only improve ef\ufb01ciency and accuracy in clinical work\ufb02ows but also contribute to better glycemic control and reduced risks of complications for patients [88]. AI also plays a transformative role in oral drug therapy by predicting drug ef\ufb01cacy and aiding in personalized drug selection. Predictive modelling techniques enable the strati\ufb01cation of patients based on genetic, clinical, and metabolic pro\ufb01les to identify the most effective oral hypoglycemic agents [89]. Recent studies have highlighted us- ing ML algorithms to analyse patient data and optimize drug responsiveness, improving therapeutic outcomes. For instance, AI has been utilized to predict patient adherence patterns, enabling healthcare providers to pre-emptively address barriers to treatment compliance. This application signi\ufb01cantly enhances precision med- icine in diabetes care, fostering a more individualized and practical approach to oral pharmacotherapy [90]. A. Sen, P.S. Mohanraj, V. Laxmi et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis 15 (2025) 101305 6 5.1. Personalized insulin therapy through AI Personalized insulin therapy has emerged as a promising avenue for improving the management of T2DM. This article ex- plores the role of AI in tailoring insulin therapy to individual pa- tients, thereby enhancing treatment outcomes and patient well- being. Furthermore, AI has the potential to enhance patient engagement and adherence to insulin therapy. Researchers have highlighted the use of AI-driven chatbots to provide real-time support and education to T2DM patients on insulin therapy [91]. These chatbots can answer questions, offer reminders for medica- tion administration, and provide lifestyle recommendations, thereby improving patient self-management. It is worth noting that the integration of AI in personalized insulin therapy is a rapidly evolving \ufb01eld with ongoing research and development. These include ML models, wearable devices, and smartphone applications that continuously monitor and optimize insulin therapy (Fig. 3). 5.2. AI-driven algorithms for insulin dosage A study by Nayak et al. [92] demonstrated that voice-based conversational AI applications could assist patients with T2DM in titrating basal insulin at home, thus achieving rapid glycemic control. The potential for AI to improve the management of T2DM is clear and holds great promise for the future of diabetes care. 5.3.

The potential for AI to improve the management of T2DM is clear and holds great promise for the future of diabetes care. 5.3. Predictive modelling in insulin management Predictive modelling in insulin management for T2DM has seen signi\ufb01cant advancements, particularly through the integration of AI and ML techniques. A key area of development is the use of ML approaches for predicting disease progression and management. Lim et al. [93] provided a comprehensive overview of how pre- dictive modelling, including ML methods, is reshaping the man- agement of T2DM, offering more personalized and effective treatment plans. In a similar vein, Lin et al. [94] developed a deep learning-based glucose trajectory prediction system for individuals with T2DM, showing promising results in controlling glucose levels. However, the system also indicated increased stress levels in participants, pointing to the need for further research to re\ufb01ne these AI-aided health management systems. The LIGHTNING study by Pettus et al. [95] aimed to use ML to predict hypoglycemic event rates in T2DM patients receiving different basal insulin treatments. This study underscores the potential of predictive modelling in identifying patient subgroups at lower risk of hypoglycemia and in foreseeing cost savings related to hypoglycemia. Additionally, Far- uqui et al. [96] developed an online nurse-in-the-loop predictive control model that utilized a predictive digital twin trained on participants' self-monitoring data, which provided individualized feedback and recommendations, demonstrating improvements in daily steps and dietary intake for T2DM patients. While these de- velopments are promising, they also bring to light the challenges and need for ongoing research to fully realize the bene\ufb01ts of AI and ML in diabetes care. 5.4. Synergies between therapeutic advances and AI The synergies between therapeutic advances and AI in the\ufb01eld of T2DM care are rapidly transforming the landscape of diabetes management. AI's integration into diabetes care promises enhanced blood glucose control, reduced complications, and improved patient satisfaction. This integration spans various do- mains, including automated retinal screening, clinical decision support, predictive population risk strati\ufb01cation, and patient self- Fig. 2.

While there are challenges and bar- riers to overcome, the potential bene\ufb01ts of AI in enhancing patient care, treatment ef\ufb01cacy, and healthcare ef\ufb01ciency in T2DM are immense. 5.5. Integrating pharmacotherapy with AI The integration of pharmacotherapy with AI in T2DM care is emerging as a transformative approach, although it is still in the nascent stages of development [99]. Developments in this area include the creation of AI-driven CDSS. These systems utilize pre- dictive analytics to generate treatment pathways, thereby improving chronic disease care and demonstrating potential applicability to other chronic conditions [5]. Lee et al. [100] also highlighted the effectiveness of an integrated digital healthcare platform with AI- driven dietary management, resulting in better glycemic control and more weight loss in adults with T2DM. Wu et al. [101]d i s c u s s e d the potential of an AI-based health education program to improve self-management abilities and blood glucose control in primary healthcare settings. Overall, the integration of pharmacotherapy with AI in T2DM care is a burgeoning\ufb01eld, with studies indicating its potential to enhance diabetes management through improved decision-making, patient education, and personalized care. 5.6. Big data analysis and ML in T2DM The intersection of big data analysis and ML has revolutionized the management and prediction of T2DM. By using extensive data from EHR genomics, lifestyle factors, and glucose monitoring, these technologies provide valuable insights into disease progression and patient behavior. ML algorithms, capable of learning from complex datasets and improving over time, are particularly well-suited for analyzing the intricate patterns within big data [102]. Navazi et al. [103] highlighted the use of hybrid meta-heuristic ML algorithms for early diagnosis, demonstrating that integrating ML techniques with big data signi\ufb01cantly enhances diagnostic accuracy. Similarly, Zhang et al. [104] showed that ML models could effectively predict T2DM development using only self-reported information, under- scoring the accessibility and utility of such data in predictive ana- lytics. These\ufb01ndings illustrate the critical role of big data and ML in facilitating early diagnosis and timely intervention in T2DM. Beyond early diagnosis, big data and ML have also shown promise in predicting complications and personalizing treatment plans for T2DM patients. Studies like those by Abhari et al. [4]a n dS u b - ramaniyan et al. [105] emphasise the necessity of using large data- sets to achieve accurate and generalizable predictive models. Fig. 3.

[106] highlighted that integrating clinical data with ML enhances the predictive power of diabetes management systems. Moreover, Nibareke and Laassiri [107], and Tigga and Garg [108] demonstrated the utility of multiple ML tools and classi\ufb01cation methods in improving diabetes prediction and management. These advancements not only enable healthcare providers to tailor treat- ment plans based on individual patient pro\ufb01les but also facilitate the early identi\ufb01cation of potential complications, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. Overall, the inte- gration of big data and ML in T2DM care represents a signi\ufb01cant leap forward in personalized medicine and predictive healthcare. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for predicting complications associated with T2DM. CNNs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in the early detection of diabetic retinopathy through retinal image analysis, outperforming traditional diagnostic methods in accuracy and sensitivity [86]. These models excel at identifying microaneurysms and other subtle retinal changes that may not be apparent to human evaluators. Similarly, advanced neural network architectures are being utilized to predict diabetic nephropathy by analyzing a combination of clinical, biochemical, and imaging data. These models enable the identi\ufb01cation of high-risk individuals and facilitate early interventions to prevent or mitigate kidney damage. Integrating such deep learning techniques into routine care provides an unprecedented opportunity for precision diagnostics, allowing for timely and targeted management of diabetes-related complications [109]. 5.7. Future directions and implications for use of AI The future directions and implications of integrating AI in T2DM care are multifaceted, offering exciting prospects for enhancing pa- tient care and management. While speci\ufb01c studies focusing solely on T2DM are limited, the broader implications in diabetes care and AI applications provide valuable insights. The effectiveness of AI in obesity management, a common comorbidity in T2DM, suggests potential collaborative opportunities. Hinchliffe et al. [110] noted the role of digital health technologies, including ML and AI, in auto- mating and personalizing interventions in obesity care. An essential area of future exploration is the potential for AI-enhanced technol- ogies to support individuals with diabetes during signi\ufb01cant life transitions, such as moving from home to university for young adults. Research\ufb01ndings consistently point to the pivotal intersection where technological innovation converges with the personalized needs and experiences of individuals grappling with the management of T1D. This critical juncture highlights the potential for technology to be tailored and responsive to the diverse and unique requirements of those navigating the complexities of T1D [87]. Identifying and ana- lysing factors that in\ufb02uence the usability of these applications is crucial for their effective implementation in diabetes care [85].

The consistent decrease in HbA1C levels re\ufb02ects not only the ef\ufb01cacy of this integrated approach but also hints at the trans- formative impact on the long-term health outcomes of individuals with diabetes. This shift in self-management practices signi\ufb01 es a departure from conventional approaches, highlighting the potential of technology-driven interventions to enhance the effectiveness of diabetes care. The future directions in AI and T2DM care are geared towards enhancing patient support through technology, improving data usability and interpretation, and exploring novel ways to manage diabetes more effectively. 5.8. Potential barriers and challenges in the use of AI Implementing AI in the care of individuals with T2DM en- counters numerous potential barriers and challenges, necessitating thoughtful solutions to unlock its maximum bene\ufb01ts. Research indicates that complex technological concerns, the active engage- ment of patients, ethical considerations, safeguarding data privacy, health disparities, reservations among clinicians, regulatory con- straints and the requirement for well-balanced strategies and collaborative research initiatives emerge as pivotal challenges that require careful attention and resolution [113]. Goldstein et al. [114] further emphasise that hurdles such as regulatory approval, reim- bursement processes, updates to quality measures, and the local- ised optimisation of clinical work\ufb02ows pose additional challenges in integrating AI into diabetes care [115]. The conceptualisation and development of a prototype for virtual assistant software designed to facilitate self-care among older adults managing T2DM under- score a crucial aspect of healthcare innovation. In recognising the diversity within the T2DM patient population, particularly among older adults, the prototype highlights the importance of moving beyond one-size-\ufb01ts-all solutions. By tailoring virtual assistant software to cater speci\ufb01cally to the distinct requirements of older adults, the approach becomes more personalized and attuned to the unique challenges and preferences prevalent in this de- mographic [116]. Furthermore, patient perceptions of AI applications in health- care play a crucial role. The research conducted by Esmaeilzadeh and colleagues indicates that the medical condition and the clinical interaction affect factors such as privacy worries, trust dilemmas, communication obstacles, apprehensions about regulatory norms, liability hazards, and the willingness to utilize services. This un- derscores the importance of building trust and ensuring trans- parency in AI applications [117].

Shah et al. [120] highlight the accessibility of diabetic retinopathy screening in pri- mary care settings as a barrier, emphasising the need for wide- spread and accessible screening methods. The future implementation of AI in T2DM care is laden with challenges related to technology, ethics, regulation, patient engagement, and trust. Addressing these barriers requires multidisciplinary efforts, regu- latory framework development, patient-centric approaches, and continuous research and innovation. 6. Bridging the gap between AI and therapeutics in T2DM management Integrating AI into managing T2DM can revolutionise patient care by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, personalizing treatment plans, and improving overall health outcomes. However, despite AI's promising capabilities, signi\ufb01cant barriers impede its seamless incorporation into therapeutic strategies. Addressing these chal- lenges through interdisciplinary collaboration, education, and robust regulatory frameworks is crucial for harnessing the full potential of AI in diabetes care. This section explores the multi- faceted challenges of integrating AI with therapeutics in T2DM management and proposes comprehensive solutions to bridge these gaps [6]. A. Sen, P.S. Mohanraj, V. Laxmi et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis 15 (2025) 101305 9 6.1. Challenges in integration Integrating AI into T2DM management presents numerous technological, ethical, and practical challenges. One primary chal- lenge is data standardisation and integration. AI systems require vast amounts of high-quality data to function effectively, but the data used in healthcare often comes from disparate sources and in various formats. This lack of standardisation makes compiling and analysing data ef\ufb01ciently tricky [87]. Additionally, data quality can vary signi\ufb01cantly, with issues such as missing information or inaccurate entries further complicating the integration process [117]. Ethical concerns also pose signi\ufb01cant barriers. AI systems in healthcare must navigate the complex landscape of patient privacy and data security. Ensuring that AI applications comply with reg- ulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is crucial to maintaining patient trust and protecting sensitive health information [118]. There are also concerns about bias in AI algo- rithms, which can result from biased data sets or algorithmic design, potentially leading to unequal treatment outcomes among different patient populations [119]. From a practical standpoint, healthcare providers' acceptance and adoption of AI technologies can be slow. Clinicians may be sceptical about the reliability of AI systems or may lack the necessary training to use these tools effectively. Furthermore, integrating AI into existing healthcare work\ufb02ows requires signi\ufb01- cant changes in infrastructure and processes, which can be resource-intensive and disruptive [120]. Financial constraints also play a role, as developing and implementing AI technologies in- volves substantial investment, which may not be feasible for all healthcare settings [121]. Integrating AI into diabetes management faces several chal- lenges that hinder its seamless adoption and widespread applica- tion. One signi\ufb01cant barrier is the lack"}

One signi\ufb01cant barrier is the lack of data standardization, as healthcare data often originates from disparate sources and for- mats. Developing standardized data-sharing protocols is essential for ef\ufb01cient AI model training and application. Another critical issue is ensuring patient privacy, as AI systems require access to sensitive health information. Solutions like advanced encryption techniques and federated learning frameworks can mitigate privacy concerns while maintaining robust data utilization. Furthermore, integrating AI into clinical work \ufb02ows requires comprehensive training programs for clinicians to enhance their understanding and usability of AI tools. By addressing these challenges through technological advancements and education, AI can achieve its full potential in improving diabetes care. 6.2. Potential solutions To overcome these challenges, a multi-faceted approach involving interdisciplinary collaboration, education and training, standardisation and regulation, and patient-centric approaches is necessary. 6.2.1. Interdisciplinary collaboration Effective integration of AI into T2DM management requires collaboration between diverse\ufb01elds, including computer science, endocrinology, data science, and ethics. Such interdisciplinary collaboration can ensure that AI systems are designed with a comprehensive understanding of both the technological possibil- ities and the clinical realities. For instance, collaboration between data scientists and clinicians can help identify relevant clinical variables to include in AI models, improving their accuracy and utility [84]. Additionally, involving ethicists in the development process can help address potential biases and ensure ethical considerations are incorporated from the outset [113]. 6.2.2. Education and training To effectively embrace AI technologies in healthcare, we must prioritize comprehensive education and training for healthcare providers. This investment will empower them to leverage these advancements con\ufb01dently and improve patient care. Training programs should focus on enhancing the digital literacy of clini- cians, helping them understand how AI tools work, how to inter- pret AI-generated insights, and how to integrate these tools into their clinical practice. Continuous education initiatives can also help clinicians stay updated with the latest advancements in AI and its applications in diabetes care [100]. Furthermore, fostering a culture of openness to technological innovation within healthcare institutions can help mitigate resistance to adopting new technol- ogies [111]. 6.2.3. Standardisation and regulation Standardisation of data formats and protocols is crucial for the seamless integration of AI into healthcare. Establishing typical data collection, storage, and sharing standards can facilitate the devel- opment of robust AI models that can be applied across different healthcare settings. Regulatory frameworks should also be adapted to address AI's unique challenges in healthcare. This includes developing guidelines for the ethical use of AI, ensuring trans- parency in AI decision-making processes, and implementing mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the performance of AI systems [120]. Regulatory bodies need to work closely with AI developers, healthcare providers, and patients to create regulations that protect patients while encouraging innovation [97]. 6.2.4.

Patient-centric approaches Incorporating patient perspectives into the design and imple- mentation of AI technologies is essential for ensuring these tools meet the needs of those they are intended to help. Engaging pa- tients in the development process can provide valuable insights into their preferences, concerns, and needs, leading to the creation of more user-friendly and effective AI applications. Moreover, educating patients about the bene\ufb01ts and limitations of AI can help build trust and encourage them to participate actively in their care [101]. Personalized AI-driven tools that provide tailored recom- mendations and support can enhance patient engagement and adherence to treatment plans, ultimately improving health out- comes [92]. 7. AI-driven CDSS AI-driven CDSS have revolutionized the management of T2DM by enhancing predictive analytics, risk strati\ufb01cation, and person- alized treatment recommendations. These systems leverage ML algorithms to analyse vast amounts of patient data, identifying patterns and trends that enable the prediction of health outcomes such as hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia events. This predictive capability allows healthcare providers to intervene proactively, adjusting treatment plans before adverse events occur, thereby improving patient safety and outcomes. AI-CDSS can categorise patients into different risk levels, prioritising high-risk individuals for more intensive management, which is crucial for preventing complications associated with T2DM, such as cardiovascular dis- ease and diabetic nephropathy. Moreover, AI-CDSS generates personalized treatment recommendations by considering many factors, including genetic data, lifestyle choices, and comorbid conditions. This tailored approach enhances treatment adherence and ef\ufb01cacy, aligning closely with patients' needs and preferences. AI-CDSS can optimize insulin therapy by continuously monitoring A. Sen, P.S. Mohanraj, V. Laxmi et al. Journal of Pharmaceutical Analysis 15 (2025) 101305 10 glucose levels and other relevant parameters, suggesting precise insulin dosages and timing, thus reducing the risk of errors and enhancing glucose management. These systems also facilitate shared decision-making by providing options and potential out- comes, empowering patients to actively participate in their care, which has been shown to improve satisfaction and adherence [122]. However, the implementation of AI-CDSS in diabetes care faces signi\ufb01cant challenges. Data standardisation and integration with existing healthcare infrastructure are critical issues that must be addressed to ensure seamless interoperability. Additionally, there are concerns about data privacy and security, as AI systems require access to sensitive patient information. Ensuring robust safeguards and compliance with regulatory standards like GDPR and HIPAA is essential. Furthermore, the acceptance and trust of AI among healthcare providers can be hindered by a lack of understanding or scepticism about the accuracy of these systems. Education and training pro- grams are crucial to build con \ufb01dence and familiarity with AI technologies.

Education and training pro- grams are crucial to build con \ufb01dence and familiarity with AI technologies. Finally, continuous evaluation and validation of AI- CDSS are necessary to ensure their reliability and effectiveness in real-world settings [123]. Addressing these issues through robust regulatory frame- works, interdisciplinary collaboration, and continuous evaluation is essential for maximising the potential of AI-CDSS in diabetes care. Studies have demonstrated that AI-CDSS can signi\ufb01cantly enhance clinical decision-making, improve glycemic control, and reduce complications, promising a transformative impact on diabetes management. As AI technologies continue to evolve, they hold the potential to further revolutionise diabetes care by enabling more precise, proactive, and personalized management strategies [124]. 8. Predictive modelling for complication prevention Predictive modelling has become crucial in managing T2DM by enabling early identi\ufb01cation and preventing complications. These models use ML algorithms to analyse extensive patient data, identifying patterns and risk factors associated with diabetes- related complications such as cardiovascular disease, nephropa- thy, retinopathy, and neuropathy. Early detection through predic- tive modelling allows healthcare providers to implement timely interventions, signi \ufb01cantly improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs. By incorporating variables like de- mographic data, clinical parameters, and lifestyle factors, predictive models can assess the risk of complications, enabling personalized treatment plans. For example, patients at high risk for diabetic nephropathy can be monitored more closely and advised on life- style changes, thereby enhancing treatment adherence and ef\ufb01cacy [125]. However, implementing predictive models faces several challenges, including data quality, privacy concerns, and the need for continuous model validation. Ensuring robust data protection and compliance with regulations like HIPAA is essential for main- taining patient trust. Additionally, integrating predictive models with EHR systems enhances their utility by providing real-time data analysis and risk assessment, facilitating prompt and informed decision-making. Despite these challenges, the future of predictive modelling in T2DM management looks promising, with advancements expected to incorporate a broader range of data sources, including wearable devices and genomic data. These developments could further enhance the precision and utility of predictive models, paving the way for more proactive and personalized diabetes care, ultimately transforming T2DM management by enabling early intervention and reducing complications [126]. 9. Conclusion In conclusion, integrating AI in managing T2DM presents a paradigm shift with vast potential to improve patient outcomes. This article has highlighted key \ufb01ndings that emphasise the trans- formative impact of AI in various aspects of T2DM care, including predictive analytics, personalized treatment regimens, patient self- management, and the enhancement of clinical decision-making processes. The key \ufb01ndings underscore AI's capability to analyse complex health data, offering more accurate predictions and personalized care plans. AI-driven predictive models can forecast disease progression and treatment responses, aiding early in- terventions. In pharmacotherapy, AI algorithms optimize drug dos- ages and reduce adverse effects, while AI-powered lifestyle management tools provide tailored dietary and exercise recom- mendations.

However, the implementation of AI in T2DM care is not without challenges. Issues such as data privacy and security, po- tential biases in AI algorithms, and the need for clinician education and acceptance have been identi\ufb01ed as signi\ufb01cant barriers. Future research should focus on improving the quality and diversity of data used in AI systems, ensuring that these technologies are represen- tative of and effective for diverse patient populations. Ethical con- siderations, particularly regarding data privacy and algorithmic bias, must be a central focus, ensuring that AI-driven healthcare advances ethically and equitably. Clinically, there is a need for a concerted effort to integrate AI tools into healthcare work\ufb02ows seamlessly. This integration requires technological advancements and a focus on educating healthcare providers about AI capabilities and limitations. Additionally, healthcare systems must address accessibility and affordability issues to ensure that the bene\ufb01ts of AI in T2DM care are available to all patients, regardless of socioeconomic status or geographical location. As research and development in this\ufb01eld continue to advance, the collaborative efforts of scientists, clinicians, and policymakers will be crucial in harnessing the full potential of AI for improving the lives of individuals living with T2DM.
